### Mission H

### Mission I

Complete a zig as soon after mission 8 as possible:

**General**

Only one player is allowed to play once you enter/start the zig. Passing
control if you are on zig:1 is acceptable, provided you have the option to pass
control. Try to have the player who is going to complete the zig enter it to
prevent confusion.

**If you have a zig in D:**

* If you have enough gold, enter it on turn 8 prior to starting mission 8.
* If you don't have enough gold to enter, complete the Tomb version of
  mission 8. Collect all the gold on Tomb:3. If you still don't have enough
  gold to enter the zig in D, continue on to the next step.

**If you don't have a zig in D or can't afford the one you have after Mission 8:**

Conditions:

* You must enter pan on turn 9 and start mission 11.
* You must enter the first zig you see that you can afford as soon as possible
  after seeing it. One exception: If you find a zig on a panlord level and
  grabbing the rune will let you finish either mission 11 or 12, you may grab
  the rune, and then decide whether you or the next player gets to play the zig.
* Your character must not leave pan before completing a zig. Doing so will
  forfeit the bonus points. 
* If you are abyssed at any time, you must re-enter pan the turn after you
  escape from  the abyss. You may not drop, pick up, throw, fire, or otherwise
  use any items. You may not move off of the gate to pandemonium. You may not
  fight any monsters while you re-enter pan from the abyss. In fact, just
  re-enter pan as soon as possible after escaping from the abyss.

Turn 9/Mission 11:

* If no zig is found after completing turn 9, pass control to the next player.
* If you find a zig you can afford before completing mission 11, you must do it.

Turn 10/Mission 12:

* You must find a zig no matter what. If you find it before completing mission
  12, you must do it yourself. Otherwise, you can choose to complete the zig or
  pass control to the next player.
