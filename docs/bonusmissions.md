must get the golden rune. Completing this bonus mission also fulfills the
requirements for mission 10.

### Mission H

Kill all 8 hellpanlords.

### Mission I

Complete a zig as soon after mission 8 as possible:

* If you have a zig in D:
  * If you have enough gold, enter it at the beginning of turn 9 at the latest.
  * If you don't have gold and Tomb will give you enough gold, do Tomb on turn 9
    and then zig at the end of turn 9 or the start of turn 10.
* If you don't have a zig in D (or it is far too expensive):
  * You must enter pan on turn 9, and you must enter the first zig you see
    that you can afford, and you must not leave pan before completing a
    zig. If no zig is found on turn 9, find a zig before you leave pan on turn
    10.
