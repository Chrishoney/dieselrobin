Dieselrobin Bonus Missions January 2013
 
Before starting a character, you must assign one mission of each tier to that
character, with no repetition between characters. (These missions are still
optional to complete.)

Tier 1 (2 points):

A - Clear Elf:3 before entering a Lair sub-branch.
B - Complete mission 2 without worshipping a god at any point.
C - Clear Blade during Mission 5 before entering Crypt.

Tier 2 (4 points):

D - Get the slimy rune on mission 4 without worshipping Jiyva at any point.
E - Get the golden rune on mission 8 without worshipping Kiku at any point.
F - Polymorph and then kill the royal jelly.

Tier 3 (6 points):

G - Orbrun Tomb: this means not entering Tomb until you are carrying the Orb, and
                 then getting the golden rune. (This also counts as mission 10.)
H - Kill all unique hellpanlords.
I - Complete a zig as soon after mission 8 as possible:
    - If you have a zig in D:
      - If you have enough gold, enter it at the end of turn 8 or the start of turn 9.
      - If you don't have gold and Tomb will give you enough gold, do Tomb on turn 9
        and then zig at the end of turn 9 or the start of turn 10.
    - If you don't have a zig in D (or it is far too expensive):
      - You must enter pan on turn 9, and you must enter the first zig you see
        that you can afford, and you must not leave pan before completing a
        zig. If no zig is found on turn 9, find a zig before you leave pan on turn
        10.
