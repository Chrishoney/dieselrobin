I will take the time to credit everyone before this repository was created once
I finish the website. I wanted to add it now to add thanks so I don't forget!

elliptic and mikee_ must be thanked for ~steal~borrowing the idea from the ADOM
community and creating the initial framework of missions and rules. more on this
and everyone else in between later :)

In no particular order, 

-Thanks to Wensley for providing me with a place to host dieselrobin stuff
temporarily without hesistation. Even though production won't be hosted on
seleniac, the fact you welcomed dieselrobin onto your server is greatly
appreciated!

-Thanks to elliptic for collaborating with me on the rules revisions. I
initially retained him as a 'consultant', but he went above and beyond and
helped me get dieselrobin #4 up and running from start to finish. I would've
missed the start deadline by a day instead of an hour if it weren't for his
help.

-Thanks to my official co-organizer of dieselrobin #4, ophanim. He was
instrumental in the initial brainstorm for rule revisions, and the majority of
the new features were his idea. 3 man teams, a saner set of constraints for
character selection, and a number of bonus missions were his ideas. I could have
not asked for a finer co-organizer. A++++++ WOULD HOST DIESELROBIN WITH AGAIN.

Many members from the ##crawl community contributed their time helping out with
proofreading rule changes, contributing ideas and advice about rules, bonus
mission ideas, and overall support. Thanks to everyone from ##crawl who helped,
