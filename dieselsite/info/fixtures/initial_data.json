There are 3 tiers of missions, with 3 missions per tier.\n * Scoring formulae\n * Combo selection\n * 2 more days of playtime!\n \n \n *Game Version:* Trunk\n \n **Servers**\n \n * CAO/CSZO - tiles, console or a mix of both\n * CDO - console only\n \n **Combo Selection** \n \n Combo selection: Each player will choose one race/class combination. Players are\n encouraged to choose combos which allow for a reasonable amount of flexibility.\n Combos  which force a certain playstyle or set of circumstances are interesting\n to play solo, but can be frustrating (or boring, in the case of overpowered\n combos) in an ad-hoc team environment. Combos of the latter nature may be\n replaced at the discretion of the organizers. In addition, some number of\n randomly chosen combos may be replaced. All replacements will come from the\n oldwon pool.\n \n **Time Frame**\n \n The competition will start on a Friday at 19:00 UTC and will end 16 days later\n on Sunday at 19:00 UTC. Any games still in progress will be scored as if they\n died of old age at that point. The start and end times will be posted in\n `??dieselrobin[4]`\n \n \n ##Teams\n \n ###Composition\n \n Teams are made up of 3 players. The account must be owned by a single\n individual, which means NO ROBIN ACCOUNTS. Players are allowed to form their\n own teams or join up solo and get assigned to a team randomly. Team rosters are\n frozen 48 hours after the start of the competition. \n \n ###Substitutions\n \n If a player disappears for 48 hours when it is their turn to play a character or\n otherwise gives notice of being unable to take their turn, the rest of their\n team may ask anyone not already on a team to take that turn for them.\n \n ###Naming\n \n Each team should choose a team name and three account names. Account\n names **must** be in ALLCAPS. Each team also needs to pick an order of play and\n decide which player will start which character (once combos are assigned).\n \n ###Organization\n \n Making a learndb entry with your team's information might be a good idea. An example:\n \n     team dd guide[1/3]: elliptic, pivotal, ophanim. Accounts: MAKHLEB \n     (TrHu), USETHEWAND (HuSu), RECHARGEIT (DrEE). Play order: elliptic ->\n     ophanim -> pivotal -> elliptic.\n \n You should also duplicate the [scoring sheet template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AsDUl9FTpJmLdEh2ZnYtUlp3a3BESWJlUERqYklCdUE)\n and use that speadsheet to keep track of your team\u2019s progress.\n \n \n ##For Players\n \n ###Turns\n \n When it is your turn to play a character, you must complete exactly one\n \"mission\" and then pass the character to the next player. Bonus missions can be\n completed in tandem with a standard mission. The first few missions are fixed,\n but later on you will usually have a choice of a few missions that can be done\n in any order. You can backtrack to areas of earlier missions at any time, but\n you may not enter new locations until you are starting the corresponding\n mission. If you find yourself shafted past the current allowed levels in D or V,\n you must ascend back to permitted levels as quickly as possible. See the\n \"Missions\" section for a list of all the missions.\n \n ###Death or Victory\n \n You get twenty tries to complete the first mission successfully. After the\n twentieth try and in all later missions, deaths are permanent and mean the end\n of the character. The other way a character can finish is by winning, which you\n may attempt to do at any time after obtaining 3 runes. If a character has\n completed every mission, the next player must attempt to win.\n \n \n ##Missions:\n \n ###Regular Missions\n \n Each mission consists of a task or tasks that must be completed before\n the character can be passed to the next player along with a list of locations\n that become available for exploration once the mission is started. You may not\n begin one mission and then decide that it is too hard and do another mission\n instead; once begun, the only options are completion, death, or going to Zot and\n winning instead. You do not have to stop immediately when you have completed the\n tasks in the mission; they are just the minimum you have to do.\n \n These missions will be in the `??mission` entry in the learndb and at [dieselrobin.org](http://dieselrobin.org/rules) for easy reference.\n \n \n ###Bonus Missions\n \n There are 3 tiers of bonus missions: Tier 1 (2 points each), Tier 2 (4 points\n each), and Tier 3 (6 points each)\n \n The missions themselves will be kept secret until the start of the tournament.\n Your team will assign one mission from each tier to each character before\n starting a mission on any character.\n \n Once you have started a mission, the bonus mission assignments are frozen.\n The bonus mission assignments will be placed on the scoring sheet for your team.\n \n If you are unable to assign all your missions due to character/class/race\n makeup, we will swap a conflicting mission with an alternate mission for that\n tier that can be completed.\n \n \n ##Scoring\n \n ###Regular Missions\n \n Each completed mission is worth one point. Mission 1 must be completed without\n dying to earn the point. Winning a character is worth 3 points. Thus the maximum\n possible regular mission score for each character is 17 points. \n \n ###Bonus Missions\n \n Each completed bonus mission is worth the number of points assigned to it.\n \n ###Total Score\n \n The character who scores the lowest on the regular mission will have their\n regular mission score dropped. Any bonus missions completed by this character\n are still worth points. \n \n 3\\*highest regular score + min(2\\*2nd highest regular score, 21) + Tier 1 completed\\*2 + Tier 2 completed\\*4 + Tier 3 completed\\*6\n  \n Max score: 51 + 21 + 6 + 12 + 18 = 108\n \n ###Ties\n \n In the event that two or more teams have the same final mission score, each team\n will create a new account and start a MuCK. You may not abandon Xom at any point\n during a tiebreaker, and once you die, it's game over dude. No restarts on\n Mission 1.  The starting player can be any player on your team, but the original\n play order must be maintained after Mission 1. Once all teams have died or won,\n the team with the highest score will win.\n", "type": "rules"}}]
